This project demonstrates the development of a system that automatically extracts technical and soft skills from resumes using Amazon Comprehendâ€™s Custom Entity Recognition (NER) feature. It aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of resume parsing in recruitment processes by automating the extraction of relevant information.

### Key Features
- Trained a custom NER model to identify entities such as programming languages, tools, certifications, and soft skills  
- Utilized Amazon Comprehend and Amazon S3 for scalable and secure model training and data handling  
- Implemented IAM roles to manage access to S3 buckets and Comprehend services  
- Validated the model using test documents, with results stored and visualized from JSON outputs  

### Tools and Technologies
- Amazon Comprehend  
- Amazon S3  
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)  
- Python (for data preprocessing and file conversion)  
- Dataset: Resume Entities for NER (Kaggle)  

### Dataset Preparation
- Downloaded the JSON dataset from Kaggle  
- Converted resume content into plain text files  
- Created an entity list CSV for model training  
- Uploaded all training and testing data to an Amazon S3 bucket
